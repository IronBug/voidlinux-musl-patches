# voidlinux-musl-patches

Patches for *Void Linux* with *musl* library.

Here I plan to put some patches for [*Void Linux*](http://www.voidlinux.eu/) built with [*musl*](https://www.musl-libc.org/) library ( that I created during my experiments with building it from sources.

I use Void Linux with musl on my main working notebook now and it's ready for use, light and robust. I liked it and decided to add some more utilities I needed to it. I patched and built some utilities and plan to make *xpbs* packages for them which I gonna add here as well.

The patches have no special copyright and intended for free use by whoever is interested in Void Linux or musl library. 


Sincerely, Yana A. Kireyonok aka Iron Bug
